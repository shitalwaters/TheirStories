# TheirStories
TheirStories is a platform that aims to provide free mentorship for female, BIPOC, and non-binary students. TheirStories is also a resource hub that provides access to organizations, events, and aid.


**Inspiration**
The barrier we addressed was the lack of access of mentorship programs for women of color and non-binary POC.

**What it does**
We created a professional mentorship platform called TheirStories designed for female and non-binary students and women of color. We seek to bridge the gap in available mentorship programs for female and BIPOC STEM students. TheirStories is an information hub that provides accessible opportunities, events, and resources.

**How we built it**
After extensive industry research and competitive audit, we created the platform on Django and Figma.

**Challenges we ran into**
Time constraints for user testing and the need for more extensive research.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
Creating a meaningful project targeted to empower women. Providing a platform for women and non-binary folks to share their professional experiences and knowledge with emerging STEM leaders.

**What we learned**
User research and empathy is important throughout each step of the design process. Empathy is key in addressing issues with design.

**What's next for TheirStories**
Continue to work and improve on the prototypes.
